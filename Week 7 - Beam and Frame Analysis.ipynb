This is a helpful check we can make when constructing the shear and moment diagrams. \n",

    "The second thing to clarify relates to the sense of direction for shear and moment diagrams for vertical members. You will recall that when we constructed shear force diagrams for horizontal beams, positive shear forces (according to our deformation sign convention for shear see week 4) were drawn above the line of the structure. In other words, the shear force diagram was positive upwards. This allowed us to 'follow the loads across the structure' from left to right to build the shear force diagram, i.e. upwards pointing forces would 'push' the shear force diagram up while downwards forces would 'pull' the shear force diagram down. \n",
    "\n",
    "For vertical members, we will represent positive shears to the left of the vertical member. This allows is to follow the loads from the bottom to the top of a vertical member to build its shear force diagram. In other words, applied forces pointing to the left which induce positive internal shear (again see deformation sign convention) will push the SFD out to the left and forces to the right will push the SFD in to the right. \n",

    "The bending moment diagram is again defined as positive in the opposite direction to the shear force diagram. This is consistent with drawing the bending moment diagram on the tension face. <mark>Finally, in the examples that follow, when annotating the shear force and bending moment diagrams, the signs of moments and shears may be omitted. This is not uncommon practice as the side of the structure the diagram is drawn on also implies its sign.</mark>"
