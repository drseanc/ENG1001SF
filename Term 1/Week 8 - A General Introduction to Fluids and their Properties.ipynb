    "*A fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under the action of **shearing forces**.* A fluid will take up the shape of whatever container or surface is restraining it. As we'll see later, the fluid will exert a force on the restraining surface that acts perpendicular to the surface. \n",

    "We know that generally speaking fluids flow freely, this flow is due to the influence of shear forces. A key distinction between solids and fluids is that a fluid can offer no resistance to a shear force, unlike a solid, and so whereas a solid will generate an equal magnitude resisting force, a fluid will simply flow in response to a disturbing shear force. The disturbing force that causes a fluid to flow is typically the weight of the fluid itself. "
