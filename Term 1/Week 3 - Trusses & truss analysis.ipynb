Through some simple mechanics (that you've covered in week 1 and 2) we can quite easily trace the **load path** through a truss and visualise how forces are being transmitted through the structure and back to its supports.\n",

Their simplicity belies their exceptional ability to span very large distances with great efficiency. It's this efficiency that makes them well suited as roof and bridge structures. "

    "A truss is a structure that consists of a collection of elements connected at **pin joints or nodes**. In theory, the pin joints provide no rotational resistance and behave as hinges. The benefit of a truss is that the members are predominantly axially loaded. This means they are either in compression, tension or have no force, so-called zero force members. This makes trusses a particularly efficient structural form. This is evidenced by the fact that we see truss structures routinely employed to span large distances and efficiently withstand high loads."

As such, moments cannot be transmitted from one member into adjacent members. Only forces can be transmitted through nodes. From an engineering perspective, a truss, like any structure has one purpose, to transmit externally applied forces through the structure and back into the supports or foundations of that structure. Take the simplest form of truss as an example."

Common forms or patterns of truss have emerged in response to different use cases. Some of the most common are the **Pratt, Howe, Warren and Modified Warren**.\n",

The diagonal members are arranged so that they only develop tensile forces. The vertical members in a Pratt truss develop compression forces. This means they will typically be more robust and capable of resisting buckling. "

This is slightly less advantageous than the Pratt truss configuration as the longer diagonal members must now resist buckling in compression.  "

    "Recall when we discussed supports models in week 2. We said that roller, pin and cantilever supports were simply idealised models of real foundation/support behaviour. Well the exact same thing is true of the truss models we analyse. When we set about analysing a truss we first have to construct a model on which to base our analysis. We must remember that the model is an imperfect representation of the real world structure. It's our approximation of the actual structure and will almost never capture 100\\% of the detail of the real-world structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes these differences between model and structure are quite small, in which case we can have more confidence in our analysis. However if we're not careful the simplifying assumptions that facilitate our analysis can be so limiting that the model behaviour is not a good representation of the structure. Having an appreciation for the impact of how your assumptions degrade the accuracy of your model is crucially important.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what assumptions apply to the analysis of trusses? The first one has already been mentioned; we assume that the nodes or joints that connect members behave as pins. In other words, if we consider two members meeting at a joint, they would be free to rotate relative to each other. Now, as we've said, the implication of this is that no bending moments can be transmitted through a joint, only force. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the second assumption; the members within a truss are subject to axial loads only, tension, compression or no force. Provided all external loads are applied at joints, then no bending will be induced within any of the members. Of course if an external force was applied to a member between joints, stresses due to bending would be induced in that member, but we typical try to avoid this *'inter-nodal'* loading in trusses if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question is how valid are these assumptions? Well, regarding the pinned joints, in reality true pins allowing free rotation are very rarely provided. This is mainly driven by the relatively high cost of fabricating such joints. In a steel truss, the joints are almost always bolted or welded. As such, bending moments will be transmitted to some degree through joints and therefore within the structure. "

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "However, the geometry of the joints is usually such that their ability to transmit moment is quite limited. So our assumption usually causes model behaviour to deviate relatively little from the actual structural behaviour. With reference to the members developing only axial loads, it follows from our discussion of joints, that if inter-nodal loading is minimised, the predominant action experienced by the members will be axial force. So, all-in-all our truss models are pretty reasonable approximations of real truss structures."

This method of structural analysis brings into play a third equilibrium equation; because all of the forces acting on the sub-structure are no longer concurrent (they don't all pass through the same point), we can take the sum of the moments about any point. \n",

    "We've seen last week that if a structure has more than 3 unknown reactions, then it is statically indeterminate because we don't have enough equations of statics to solve for all of the unknowns. This is true for pin-jointed truss structures too. However, there is an extra detail to consider with trusses. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen above that there are some conditions that apply to our ability to analyse a truss; to use the joint resolution method we need joints with 2 or less unknowns and for the method of sections we can accommodate no more than 3 unknowns. If these conditions are not met, we will not be able to use statics to determine the forces in the structure, i.e. it is **statically indeterminate**. As we've seen above, even if we can generate an *apparently suitable* section that only cuts through three unknowns, we may still run into trouble. So we need a more rigorous method for establishing the statical determinacy of our structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can employ a simple equation that allows us to test the determinacy of a truss. Let's say that for each node, we have two possible equations, we'll let $J$ denote the number of nodes in a structure. Therefore we have access to $2\\times J$ possible equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the the number of unknowns is equal to the number of members, denoted by $M$, we might say that once $2J=M$ our truss is statically determinate. But remember, we also have three unknown reactions to solve for. So actually our condition for determinacy is $2J - 3 = M$. If this is the case we can solve for all member forces and our structure is statically determinate. If $2J-3<M$ there are too many member forces and the truss is statically indeterminate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the truss we just looked at above. It has 14 joints (A to N), therefore for statical determinacy, it should have exactly $2\\times 14 - 3 = 25$ members. It actually has 26! This confirms for us that it is indeed statically indeterminate. In fact we can say that it is statically indeterminate to 1 degree. Therefore, to analyse this structure using the equations of statics we would need to remove 1 member. **Note that we're not generally in the habit of just throwing away members - so a finding of statical indeterminacy would usually trigger us to explore alternative solution methods.** \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the purpose of discussion; we can see the result of first removing member EL (below-top) and then alternatively, removing member DK (below-bottom). In either case, we could quite easily complete our analysis by making a vertical cut between D and E and evaluating either sub-structure created by the cut. You should confirm this for yourself. It's worth noting that in both cases, the structure would remain perfectly viable and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that in both analyses, the central members carry no force, makes it tempting to consider completely removing these members. After all if they carry no force, why do we need them? Remember, we are only considering one possible load combination here. Under the action of these symmetrical applied loads, these members carry no force, but if say, the 40.5 kN at L was removed, then the members currently carrying zero force would indeed develop internal member forces. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, in the case of this particular truss with this symmetrical load combination, because so many of the members carry zero force, **if we knew this ahead of time**, we could remove one of them for the purpose of our analysis, rendering the structure statically determinate and solvable. However, **there was no way for us to determine what members had zero force using just the equations of statics**. When analysing a complex truss, it is a good idea to test its determinacy first, before embarking on a laborious hand analysis.    "
