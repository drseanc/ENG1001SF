    "\n",
    "- Establish an origin point at the skiers' location just before he departs the ramp.\n",
    "- Determine expressions for his $x$ and $y$ velocity components and integrate these to get $x$ and $y$ position as a function of time. \n",
    "- Then think about how you can use these expressions, combined with the geometry of the slope (given for a reason) to determine the time the skier lands. \n",
    "- Once you know **when** he lands it's easy to work out his position at this time.\n",
    "- Remember we're treating the skier as a projectile, so horizontal acceleration is zero and vertical acceleration is due to gravity."
