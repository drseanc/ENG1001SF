    "This actually compares favourably with steel which it's estimated generates approximately 1.5-2 tonnes of $CO_2$ per tonne of steel. However it's the vast quantities of concrete (and therefore cement) used globally that lead to concrete having such a large carbon footprint. As awareness of the need to adopt more sustainable construction practices continues to grow, you should expect to see greater justification being required for the use of concrete on construction projects. But for now there is very little that can compete with concrete in terms of versatility, availability and cost."

    "Plain concrete **on its own** actually has quite limited value as a construction material. This is because concrete is brittle and has relatively low tensile capacity by comparison to its compression capacity. A typical concrete with a compressive strength of $30 \\:N/mm^2$ would experience cracking under tensile loading at a stress of approximately $2.5-3.5\\:N/mm^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we introduce steel reinforcement as a means of resisting the tensile forces that develop in the concrete cross-section under bending. The inclusion of steel reinforcement also leads to ductile failures which are safer than sudden explosive brittle failures. The design of reinforced concrete is a topic that civil engineers will study extensively later in their degree course."

Although they are notionally circular in cross section they have a deformed surface to improve the mechanical bond between the steel and encasing concrete. They are supplied in common diameters; $[6, 8, 10,12,16,20,25,32,40]\\:mm$. The process of manually building rebar cages on site is a relatively slow and labour intensive task that requires a skilled workforce and extensive oversight. "

    "During concrete pouring it is critical that voids do not develop within the body of the concrete. Heavily reinforced concrete with elaborate reinforcement cages are particularly prone to voids as it can be difficult to ensure the concrete flows completely around the cages. \n",
    "\n",
    "This must be avoided by 'compacting' the concrete during the pouring process. This involves manual vibration and tamping of the concrete to help it flow completely around the steel reinforcement cages and formwork. Voids can reduce the strength of the concrete and reduce the bond between concrete and steel, diminishing their composite action. Compaction is usually achieved with mechanical poker vibrators that are lowered into the concrete. Care must be taken not to over vibrate the concrete as this can lead to separation with water rising to the surface inhibiting the hydration reaction."
