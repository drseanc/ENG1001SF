Carbon also allows the steel to be hardened by rapid cooling from high temperatures. However, carbon also reduces the ductility of the steel leading to brittleness.\n",

    "All steel starts life as iron ore which is mined from the ground. In a process known as smelting, iron is extracted from the ore. This involved heating the ore and combining it with another element such as carbon in the form of coke. This decomposes the ore into the base metal, iron in this case and slag, a waste bi-product. This process takes place in a blast furnace. The resulting iron is known as pig iron which has a high carbon content. \n",
