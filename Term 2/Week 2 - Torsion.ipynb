    "At the beginning of term 1, we discussed trusses and observed that the members that make up a truss experience only axial force. We could say that the *action* on these members was axial force. We then discussed structural elements whose primary actions were shear force and bending (beams and frames). What distinguished an axial force from a shear force was the axis along which the force was applied; axial forces were applied parallel to the logitudinal axis of the member while shear forces were applied perpendicular to this axis. When discussing bending moments, we didn't labour the point at the time, but the moments considered were all about an axis perpendicular to the page or perpendicular to the plane of the member considered, see below.

As a result, the original element $abcd$ becomes $ab'c'd$ with $b$ rotating to $b'$ and $c$ rotating to $c'$. Because we have made the initial assumption that the angle of rotation between the ends of the bar is small, we can say that the lengths of the sides $ab'$ and $dc'$ remain unchanged. From this we can can conclude that the deformation of the element $abcd$ is completely defined by the decrease in the angle $bad$. We recognise this as a shear deformation and conclude that the element is in pure shear (i.e. only experiencing shear strain). "
